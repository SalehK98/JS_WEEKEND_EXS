/* “Write a function to return an n element in Fibonacci sequence” is one of the most common 
questions you can hear during the coding challenge interview part. In this blogpost I’m going to 
walk through the two of the most typical solutions for this problem and also cover a dreadful (for 
most of novice developers) topic of time complexity. 
So what is a Fibonacci sequence? According to ​Wikipedia​: 
“In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, 
called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first 
two is the sum of the two preceding ones.” 
Depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence (0 or 1) the sequence would look like 
this: 
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... 
or this: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... */


// const fibonacci = n => {
//     if (n <= 1) return n
//     return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
// }

const fibonacci = (n) => {
    if (n < 2) return n
    return (fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2))
}


console.log(fibonacci(5));
console.log(fibonacci(4));
console.log(fibonacci(6));
console.log(fibonacci(19));
console.log(fibonacci(22));
